						Mike changed my life. If you were lucky enough to find Mike and his company you should hire him immediately. For years my business struggled, I would have high hopes and shattered dreams every time a new business partner or marketing firm came along. I was toiling in relative obscurity when Mike found me. He emailed to let me know that he liked what I was doing and shared a few tactics that he thought I could use to grow my business with Facebook. The tactics seemed brilliant, but I was skeptical. I followed up and asked him to clarify a few things for me. He emailed me again and I was blown away. In two emails Mike provided more value than any marketer or business partner I've ever met. I knew I needed to work with Mike, he instantly understood me and my business. I hired his company that day. Mike started implementing the strategy that he'd outlined in the emails. Overnight he quadrupled my Facebook following from 1,500 fans to over 6,000... and I'm mean literally overnight! Then the sales started rolling in and I realized that getting that first email from Mike was one of the best things that could have happened to me. My business is built around my purpose in life, spreading a few simple practices that help people achieve true health. Thanks to Mike I'm fulfilling that purpose and I know he can help do the same thing for you and your business. Honestly, for selfish reasons I should tell you not to hire Mike. I would love to have him all to myself. I know his company can deliver exactly what you need. I was lucky to have Mike find me, but if you were lucky enough to find Mike... Hire him now and this will be the day your business starts building unstoppable momentum. -CK.

							My dental care business had very poor traffic even though we offer top quality products and services. I engaged some services online to fix this problem severally but with no tangible result. Then I got a tip off from a business partner who is enjoying exceptional results using Maknetix. A few months ago I started using Maknetix for my digital marketing and the results are unimaginably through the roof.  I can boldly declare that this is one of the best business decisions I have made this year. If you want digital marketing with results, talk to Maknetix crew they simply know how to get it for you.

         <h5>1. The Power of Quality</h5>
         <p>
         Quality trumps quantity. Itâ€™s better to have 1,000 online connections who read, share and talk about your content with their own audiences than 10,000 connections who disappear after connecting with you the first time.
         </p>
         <h5>2. The Power of Influence</h5>
         <p>
         Spend time finding the online influencers in your market who have quality audiences and are likely to be interested in your products, services and business. Connect with those people and work to build relationships with them. If you get on their radar as an authoritative, interesting source of useful information, they might share your content with their own followers, which could put you and your business in front of a huge new audience.
         
         </p>
         <h5>3. The Power of Value</h5>
         <p>
         If you spend all your time on the social Web directly promoting your products and services, people will stop listening. You must add value to the conversation. Focus less on conversions and more on creating amazing content and developing relationships with online influencers. In time, those people will become a powerful catalyst for word-of-mouth marketing for your business.

			Human-to-human connections are the heart and soul of business.

Revenue is something that happens as a byproduct of a sound business model and a positive customer experience.

			Good stories give big voices to small ventures. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s mission-critical that companies take the time up front to fully develop their approaches to storytelling.

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel3">Top benefits of hiring a digital marketing agency.</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
         <p>
			Gone are the days when hiring a marketing agency was considered as an expensive matter. But with the increasing competition in the market and social media, companies are now considering to invest on hiring a digital marketing agency.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main focus of hiring the agency is to get a strong online presence and get ahead of the competition.
		</p>
		<p>
			Small and medium-sized companies set aside their own budget for online marketing. The good news is that small and medium-sized businesses believe that the hiring agency is a profitable investment.
		</p>
		<p>
			This article explains the main benefits of hiring a digital marketing agency:
		</p>
		<p>
			Online Technological Competence: The marketing agency is supported by a professional team of tech experts who supports up-to-date through online media. The team understands how and when to use the online expertise to get the best return on marketing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cheaper than offline marketing: Previously, a company had a limited option to advertise their brand on print and TV, which was quite expensive. But as the time changed and social media took over, companies are now exploring digital media, which is very economical than offline. The company must pay the Agency a fixed amount monthly and get brands promoted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Online Marketing Data: Agencies hold data from many companies and have a lot of technical insights to share on with the client. This collaborative work helps the website to grow online.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quick Reach to Target Audience: One of the benefits of hiring the digital marketing agency is the fast reach to the target audience. The agency has insights and data of consumer behavior and accordingly implements the plan to promote the brand. This certainly leads to an effective audience that is faster.
		</p>
		<p>
			Supported by valuable resources: Regular social media updates and lead generation are valuable resources that a company gets. In addition, the company has a good backup of strong analytic and media experts who understand the market well and generate an idea for the campaign accordingly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bringing down the Burden: Company runs through different departments and needs to look after each department. By handing over, the marketing role to the agency can reduce the burden on the company and concentrate on other departments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lot More than Marketing: A digital agency is not limited to marketing, but also has a good resource for a content writer, SEO, graphic designer, and web designer. So, by doing only one agency, you can also access other areas of marketing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Save money and time on training: Hire a separate team and training them for social media can consume time and money. Most renowned digital agencies have trained professionals and ready to work for you and operate all your social media effectively be it facebook, twitter, Instagram and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being able to go along the current marketing trend: Online marketers stay updated with the latest marketing trend and use the same to promote your brand. Consulting companies invest time to keep the latest trend tools, technologies and strategies up-to-date.
		</p>
		<p>
			Great Leadership: Many highly successful agencies are run by great leaders who may or may not be directly with you. They imply their expertise in marketing every brand, which certainly helps the company to get a good return.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conclusion: <br>Overall, the main goal behind hiring a successful digital marketing agency is to promote your product and create a brand online for a long term.
